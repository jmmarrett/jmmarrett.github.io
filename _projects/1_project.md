Hypergolic materials are those which ignite when they come into contact with an oxidizer. Hypergolic materials are of particular interest in rocketry, where 
they can be used as fuels or fuel additives to allow for "automatic" ignition of a rocket engine when the fuel and oxidizer are mixed.

Traditional hypergolic fuels are often toxic and environmentally damaging. Because of this, there is a an effort among chemists and the broader scientific community to develop greener hypergolic materials. 

We have developed a method for inducing hypergolic behavior in metal-organic framework materials, nano-scale sponge-like materials made of metal "nodes" and organic "linkers". In particular, we have found that introducing double or triple bonds (vinyl groups or ethynyl groups, respectively) to the organic linker of a MOF will render that material hypergolic. 

We test the hypergolic performance of these materials by filming their response to a single drop of white fuming nitric acid (WFNA). The faster the ignition, the better the performance of that hypergolic material. Typically, these ignition delays (IDs) should be under 50 ms in order for the material to be useful for rocketry applications. Our MOFs show IDs which are mostly below 10 ms, and in some cases are as low as 1 ms.  



We have also found that our hypergolic MOFs can be used as additives to otherwise non-hypergolic aerospace fuels to render them hypergolic.
